### Syllabus Questions
1. What are the three deadlines you need to know for this semester?

The three deadlines we must know about are the recommended/suggested deadlines, unit deadlines, and the professional development activities deadlines. Recommended/suggested deadlines are deadlines recommended by the course staff to get a certain assignment turned in by. Unit deadlines are deadlines when a unit is completed, which is also when all the related assignments to that unit are due. The professional development activities deadline is at the end of the course, which is April 28th, but recommended deadlines to obtain a certain number of points are prior to that April 28th deadline. There is also an additional deadline if an assignment is missed/marked as incomplete, which is two days after the initial assignment deadline, but it is only applicable to two weekly assignments out of the entire semester.

2. What are *professional development activities* and who should you ask if you have any questions?

Professional development activities are various activities recommended by the staff to complete or attend to obtain more experience in knowledge in computeer science. These activties range from attending a hackathon or communicating with an alum on LinkedIn, to simply updating your profile on Handshake. However, each activity can only be done once to be counted for a certain number points, with each activity having a different number of points. A student must obtain eight points from all their write-ups of activities across the semester to pass this semester-long assignment. Madison Flynn is the person to reach out to if requesting any activities, or if you have any general questions about the professional development activities.

3. Will you need a textbook this semester?
